# Catalog Movie React JS

I made this web application in order to consolidate the skills acquired during the training of React JS. In the project, I used an unofficial Kinopoisk API, which works VERY unstable, because of this, errors may occur during the viewing of this project.

This project uses the unofficial API of Kinopoisk - https://kinopoiskapiunofficial.tech/

On the site you can:
<ul> 
  <li>Search for movies, anime, TV series, etc. by keywords (by genre, by name)</li>
  <li>View detailed information about this movie when you click</li>
  <li>Switch between movie pages (pagination)</li>
</ul>


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
